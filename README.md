# Conway's Game of Life

This is a practice project. Usage is as follows:

### Options:
`-t`: takes a mandatory integer argument specifying the number of times the game should iterate.

`-i`: takes no argument and specifies that the user will manually specify input.

When the `-i` option is passed, the terminal will first display a screen where you can navigate with WASD,
and press spacebar to cause the initial state of the cell to be alive or dead. Then, press the `Z` key to
start the game.

If the `-i` option is **not** passed, the cells will be randomly assigned an initial state of alive or dead.
